"""
The mapper.py module contains the classes used to perform the mapping of a split-compiled neural gridwork onto a k-dimensional NoC grid.
The mapper takes as input a list of elements, representing to which PE of the NoC a certain task of the dependecy graph gets mapped to.
It then produces a JSON-like list of elements, representing the mapping of the tasks onto the NoC and the communication between them.
It also produces a graphical representation of the mapping.
